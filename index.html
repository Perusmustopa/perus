            <h4 class="text-justify">Informatics Engineering is a tertiary education department that studies and applies the principles of computer science and mathematical analysis in designing,
                                    testing, developing, and evaluating operating systems, software, and computer performance. In other words, this field of study will discuss related to data processing
                                    by utilizing computer technology that uses logical principles and processes.
                                    Informatics has its own basic concepts, theories, and application developments.
                                    Informatics can support and relate to cognitive and social aspects, including the influence and social consequences of information technology in general.
                                    The use of information in various fields, such as bioinformatics, medical informatics, and information supporting library science, are some other examples of the field of informatics.
